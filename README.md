# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline – Cost Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline built to predict individual costs using demographic and lifestyle variables. It was completed as part of a graduate-level **Big Data** course at Boston College.

## 🔍 Project Overview

We developed an end-to-end solution that:
- Cleans and preprocesses raw input data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains and saves a predictive model using Scikit-learn
- Tests model accuracy and outputs predictions

The workflow simulates a real-world deployment pipeline, showing how raw inputs can be transformed into actionable predictions.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.9**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- **Joblib** (model serialization)
- **CSV** for test predictions
- Jupyter-compatible `.py` scripts

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration Note

This project was developed collaboratively with peers **Gina Occhipinti**, **Reuben Vincent**, and **Kache Shantel Lee**.  
My contributions included:
- Leading the model development
- Structuring and cleaning the dataset
- Building the final pipeline scripts
- Organizing the project repository
